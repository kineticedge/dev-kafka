                                           Supports one consumer group at the
                                           time, and instances should be
                                           inactive
                                         Has 2 execution options: --dry-run
                                           (the default) to plan which offsets
                                           to reset, and --execute to update
                                           the offsets. Additionally, the --
                                           export option is used to export the
                                           results to a CSV format.
                                         You must choose one of the following
                                           reset specifications: --to-datetime,
                                           --by-duration, --to-earliest, --to-
                                           latest, --shift-by, --from-file, --
                                           to-current, --to-offset.
                                         To define the scope use --all-topics
                                           or --topic. One scope must be
                                           specified unless you use '--from-
                                           file'.
  '--shift-by <Long: number-of-offsets>    Reset offsets shifting current offset by 'n', where 'n' can be positive or negative.
  '--state [String]                        When specified with '--describe', includes the state of the group.
                                         Example: --bootstrap-server localhost:
                                           9092 --describe --group group1 --
                                           state
                                         When specified with '--list', it
                                           displays the state of all groups. It
                                           can also be used to list groups with
                                           specific states.
                                         Example: --bootstrap-server localhost:
                                           9092 --list --state stable,empty
                                         This option may be used with '--
                                           describe', '--list' and '--bootstrap-
                                           server' options only.
